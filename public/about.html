  One of my proudest accomplishments is the e-commerce website I built for a
  local boutique fashion brand. I combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a
  visually appealing, mobile-responsive site that significantly increased the
  brand's online sales. The project involved creating a seamless shopping
  experience and enhancing the website's performance, ensuring it loads
  lightning fast.
